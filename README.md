# Satisfactory Bot
This is a simple bot for starting, stopping & restarting a Satisfactory server through Discord.
This bot itself does not contain any of the files for a Satisfactory server.

The idea is you put it in the directory where the Satisfactory server already exists, make the bot startup at boot and it will also automatically launch the Satisfactory server for you.

This bot only works with Windows.
